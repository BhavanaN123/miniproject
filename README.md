# cervical cancer prediction and forecasting


#### **Project Overview**  
Cervical cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide, but **early detection can significantly improve survival rates**. This project leverages **deep learning and machine learning** to develop an **AI-powered cervical cancer prediction system**, enabling faster and more accurate diagnosis.  

---

#### **Problem Statement**  
 Traditional **Pap smear tests** require **manual examination**, which is **time-consuming and prone to human error**.  
 **Early-stage cervical cancer is often misdiagnosed** due to subjective evaluation by pathologists.  
 There is **no widely available AI-powered system** that can both **detect cervical cancer and predict recurrence risk**.  

---

#### **Proposed Solution**  
This project integrates **deep learning (CNN, RNN) with machine learning (XGBoost, PCA, and Grey Wolf Optimizer)** to:  

✅ **Detect Cervical Cancer** → Using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** to analyze **Pap smear images** and classify them as **Normal, Precancerous, or Cancerous**.  
✅ **Predict Recurrence Risk** → Using **Recurrent Neural Networks (LSTM, GRU)** to forecast the **probability of cancer recurrence based on patient history**.  
✅ **Optimize Feature Selection** → Using **PCA & Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO)** to enhance model efficiency and accuracy.  
✅ **Deploy the Model as a Web App** → Allowing **hospitals and research centers** to upload images and receive real-time AI-based reports.

#### **Technology Stack**  
**Deep Learning**: CNN (VGG16, ResNet50) for image classification, RNN (LSTM) for forecasting.  
**Machine Learning**: XGBoost, Random Forest for tabular data classification.  
 **Data Processing**: OpenCV, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.  
 **Web Development**: Flask (Backend), React.js (Frontend), and AWS/GCP for deployment.  

---

#### **Expected Outcomes**  
**Faster & More Accurate Cancer Diagnosis** → Reducing **manual workload for pathologists**.  
 **Improved Recurrence Prediction** → Helping doctors take **preventive measures**.  
 **Scalable AI Model** → Can be deployed in **hospitals, research labs, and mobile applications**.
